#### Description: CS50 Final Project
For my final project I dubbed it - Humanity's last hope, because that's basically what you become when you launch the web application. On the index page (index.html) you get introduced to the back story in a nostalgic way, star wars crawl text! exciting right? But the icing on the cake is the ominous music (André Rieu - O Fortuna (Carmina Burana - Carl Orff)) powered by javascript (indexScript.js) which plays in the background to set the tone.

Humanity's last hope is a series of games which you (humanity's last hope) undertake in order to save humanity from annihilation. The first game is a trivia with multiple choice questions and a free response question. All these have to be answered correctly or you fail and humanity perishes. There's a dark, apocolyptic background and eerie fonts to set up the mood. When you make a wrong choice you get redirected to a page (failed.html) which tells you, you failed, with the baddest man in the cosmos (Darth Sidious) cackling at you.

The second game, escape from Harvard Woods, is my scratch project from week 0 embeded in scratch.html. The goal is simple, escape the ghosts of harvard woods to obtain the golden key. This is the second challenge by the WorldEater. This page has a evil forest backdrop and has some styling incorporated from BootStrap.
The third and final game (Rock-Paper-Scissors.js), Rock-Paper-Scissors - implemented with javascript. In this challenge you play a game of rock-paper-scissors with the WorldEater and the first to 5 wins, wins! This is the final chance to save humanity and as usual if you fail you get redirected to failed.html. The ominous music returns in this challenge as it's the final challenge and it's there to remind you of the stakes. This page also has an apocalyptic backdrop with eerie fonts, there's instructions on how to play the game as well as image buttons denoting the three choices: Rock, Paper, Scissors. There's also blinking text behind the buttons to direct you in case you don't know how to start the game. There's a scoreboard which show's you your score, as well as the WorldEater's score and how many ties there have been. If you win, you get redirected to congratulations.html - which displays a congratulatory message and a looped video of people celebrating and invading a football field.

All the pages have unique styling with dedicated css files for each
